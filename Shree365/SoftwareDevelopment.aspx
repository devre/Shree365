<p></p>
The past decade has seen tremendous development in the convenience, sophistication and globalization of product-based or bespoke software systems.
<p></p>
While these applications have helped organizations run more effectively, they have also grown increasingly complex, with the consequences of failure inhibiting performance and having a detrimental effect on the business. The time and resources required to manage these applications are becoming a significant burden, to the point where they divert critical resources away from other initiatives and have a negative effect on growth and profitability.
<p><b><u>Some of the common technology and application challenges are:</u></b></p>
<b>» Lack of control:</b>
Informal decision making process with unclear roles and responsibilities. Inconsistent methods, process, routines and IT support in place
<p></p><b>» Business case for change is unclear:</b>
No competitive benchmarking to compare in-house performance with external delivery model.
<p></p><b>» Fixed costs of provision:</b>
Work patterns and requirements for specialized staff are hard to identify. Therefore the in-house team is resourced to manage peak workloads, and is inefficiently staffed for day-to-day requirements.
<p></p><b>» Hard to adapt:</b>
Unable to adapt quickly and efficiently to new technologies. Difficulty in scaling resources up or down to meet business requirements.
